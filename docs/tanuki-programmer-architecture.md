## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 The "Brain and Brawn" Philosophy: Pure Cognitive Layer Design

The fundamental design principle of Tanuki-Programmer is a strict separation between cognitive intelligence and mechanical execution. Our system is designed as a **pure cognitive layer**—a team of expert agents that think, plan, and delegate, but do not execute actions themselves.

-   **The Brain (Our Agent Team)**: The role of our 127 specialized agents is purely cognitive. They analyze problems, formulate multi-step plans, decide which tools to use, and interpret the results of tool execution. Our agents are **tool-aware** (they understand how to use tools like `read_file`, `write_file`, `run_terminal_cmd`) but **tool-agnostic** (they don't care which specific implementation provides these capabilities).

-   **The Brawn (Host Environment Tools)**: The role of tool execution belongs to the host environment—whether that's Cline's built-in tools, MCP servers, or any other tool-providing system. Our agents request tool usage through the standard API, and the host environment handles the actual execution and returns the results.

This separation makes our system:
- **Portable**: Works with any tool-providing environment (Cline, other IDE extensions, web interfaces)
- **Focused**: Pure cognitive intelligence without execution infrastructure concerns  
- **Compatible**: Leverages existing tool ecosystems rather than replacing them
- **Lightweight**: No tool infrastructure to maintain or deploy

This also clarifies the distinction between our **Mixture-of-Agents (MoA)** architecture and a **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** model:
-   An **MoE** is a single model with specialized internal parts (one brain, different lobes).
-   Our **MoA** is a system of multiple specialized agents that uses a team approach (many specialist brains, leveraging external tools).

### 2.2 Multi-Layer Architecture Overview

The system employs a five-layer architecture designed for foresight, execution, and adversarial review:

### 2.3 Architectural Layers

| Layer | Component | Function |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **1** | **Ingress & Sanitizer** | Input cleaning, normalization, and security validation |
| **2** | **Foresight Agent** | Multi-path planning, strategy critique, and optimal path selection |

### 2.4 Dynamic Specialization: Backbone & Adapters

The core efficiency comes from the backbone model architecture with hotswappable specialization:

#### Backbone Model
- **Base Model**: DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite (16B) with 128k context window
- **Architecture**: Advanced transformer with RoPE, SwiGLU, and Grouped-Query Attention
- **Parameters**: 16B total
- **Quantization**: IQ4_XS GGUF for balanced performance and VRAM efficiency
- **Memory Usage**: ~7.5GB VRAM (leaving a healthy ~0.5GB buffer for system stability)
- **Always Active**: Provides state-of-the-art code intelligence and reasoning.

#### LoRA Adapter System
- **127 Specialized Adapters**: Comprehensive language coverage supporting DeepSeek-Coder-V2's 338 languages (~160MB each, scaled for 16B base)
- **Instantaneous Switching**: All 127 adapters are pre-loaded into system RAM.
- **System RAM Usage**: ~20.3GB for the adapter pool (127 × 160MB, from 48GB total), eliminating all loading latency.

### 2.5 Context Management & Briefing Packets

The 128k context window enables comprehensive briefing packets for each expert:

```
<CONTEXT>
  <CONVERSATION_HISTORY>
    <!-- Complete user-AI dialogue -->
  </CONVERSATION_HISTORY>

  <RELEVANT_FILES>
    <!-- Full content of project files -->
  </RELEVANT_FILES>

  <AVAILABLE_TOOLS>
    <!-- Tool schemas provided by host environment -->
  </AVAILABLE_TOOLS>
  
  <FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES>
    <!-- Domain-specific examples -->
  </FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES>
  
  <USER_QUERY>
    <!-- Current specific request -->
  </USER_QUERY>
</CONTEXT>
```

### 2.6 Resource Management System

Sophisticated resource management ensures efficient operation:

```python
def load_adapter(agent_type: str):
    """Instantly switches the active adapter, as all are pre-loaded in RAM."""
    # No dynamic loading needed. Adapters are already in memory.
    # The 'load_lora_weights' function now just points to the active adapter.
    set_active_adapter(f"adapters/deepseek-coder-v2/{agent_type}.safetensors")
    update_system_prompt(get_agent_instructions(agent_type))
    
    # Performance: <1ms switch time as it's a simple pointer change.

def unload_lru_adapter():
    """No longer needed. All adapters are persistently loaded."""
    pass
```

### 2.7 Architectural Solutions for Complex Problem-Solving

To transition from succeeding at self-contained benchmarks to performing reliably on complex, multi-file "enterprise-grade" tasks, the architecture employs four key strategies to overcome the known limitations of LLMs.

#### 1. Countering Architectural Blindness with a Dynamic World Model

-   **Problem**: LLMs lack a persistent "mental model" of the entire codebase.
-   **Solution**: The **Orchestrator** is responsible for building and maintaining a **Dynamic World Model** for the duration of a task. This is more than a static briefing packet; it's a live, state-aware context.
    -   **Static Analysis**: For any complex task, the `tanuki-architect` is first invoked to request static analysis tools (via the host environment) to map the relevant parts of the codebase.
    -   **Dynamic Context**: This map of critical files, functions, and class definitions is injected into the context window for every subsequent step.
    -   **State Updates**: The output of every tool execution is appended to this "World Model," ensuring agents work with ground truth, not hallucinated state.

#### 2. Countering Brittle Planning with a Hierarchical, Iterative Loop

-   **Problem**: LLMs struggle to dynamically adapt multi-step plans when errors occur.
-   **Solution**: We employ a **Hierarchical & Iterative Planning Loop**, not a simple linear chain of thought.
    1.  **High-Level Plan (Foresight)**: The `tanuki-planner-critic` creates a high-level strategic plan (e.g., "1. Refactor auth service. 2. Write migration script. 3. Update web UI.").
    2.  **Sub-Task Execution (Orchestrator)**: The Orchestrator takes only the *first* high-level step ("1. Refactor auth service") and breaks it down into low-level, executable sub-tasks (e.g., tool requests to read files, analyze code).
    3.  **Verification & Update**: After each sub-task, the output is verified. If an error occurs, the error message is added to the World Model, and the Orchestrator asks the relevant agent to re-attempt the sub-task *with the new error context*.
    4.  **Iterate**: Only after the first high-level step is fully completed and verified does the Orchestrator move to the next one. This ensures the system is always in a known, good state before proceeding.

#### 3. Countering Poor Self-Correction with a Mandatory Adversarial Loop

-   **Problem**: An LLM cannot reliably find flaws in its own output.
-   **Solution**: Generated code is never trusted as final. The `Execution & Review` layer operates as a **Mandatory Adversarial Loop**.
    -   **Generation**: `tanuki-coder` (or a specialist) generates the code.
    -   **Adversarial Review**: The code is immediately passed to `tanuki-code-reviewer`, whose sole purpose is to find logical flaws, race conditions, and edge cases. Its findings are added to the World Model.
    -   **Testing**: The code is then passed to `tanuki-tester`, which must generate comprehensive tests. Test failures are also added to the World Model.
    -   **Correction Cycle**: The original `tanuki-coder` is invoked again with the critiques and failures from its peers, and is tasked with providing a fix. This loop continues until the code is approved by both adversarial and testing agents.

#### 4. Countering Hallucination with Host Environment Grounding

-   **Problem**: LLMs often hallucinate tool outputs, assuming success when an operation failed.
-   **Solution**: The **Host Environment** (e.g., Cline) serves as the ultimate "grounding" mechanism.
    -   **Execution Bridge**: The host environment is the only component that interacts with the actual operating system (file system, terminal, etc.).
    -   **Forced Reality Check**: The host environment captures the *real* `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exit_code` from every tool execution and returns it to our agents.
    -   **Error Propagation**: If a command fails, the host environment passes the verbatim error message back to our Orchestrator, which adds it to the Dynamic World Model. The agent is then forced to confront the real-world consequence of its action and generate a solution.

## 3. Training Methodology & Datasets

### 3.1 Zero-Cost Foundation Training

All foundation training leverages free, open-source datasets from Hugging Face:

| Expert Agent | Primary Dataset | Synthesis Strategy |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `tanuki-coder` | `bigcode/the-stack-v2` | Code generation examples from permissive licenses |
| `tanuki-reviewer` | `bigcode/starcoderdata` | PR discussions paired with code changes |
| `tanuki-debugger` | `microsoft/CodeXGLUE` | Bug-fixing scenarios from error descriptions |
| `tanuki-tester` | `JetBrains-Research/test-generation` | Function-test pairs for comprehensive coverage |
| `tanuki-architect` | `CShorten/ML-ArXiv-Papers` | System design patterns from CS papers |
| `tanuki-devops` | `austin-taylor/dockerfiles` | Containerization and deployment configs |
| `tanuki-documenter` | `github/CodeSearchNet` | Code-documentation pairs |
| `tanuki-optimizer` | `google-research-datasets/stackoverflow_posts` | Performance optimization Q&A |

### 3.2 Training Strategy: Distillation from a Peer-Expert Teacher

#### 1. Guiding Philosophy: Specialization through Distillation
Our strategy is to create highly specialized expert agents by fine-tuning, not by training a large model from scratch. We will employ a form of **knowledge distillation**. This involves using a powerful, instruction-tuned "teacher" model to generate high-quality examples of ideal behavior, and then using that curated dataset to efficiently fine-tune our lightweight "student" adapters.

This approach organizes the development process into two clear streams:
1.  **Prompt Engineering (The Teacher's Curriculum):** Defining *what* each agent should do via carefully crafted system prompts and instructions for generating training data.
2.  **Fine-Tuning (The Student's Study Session):** Training the LoRA adapters on the teacher-generated data to learn *how* to perform their specialized tasks efficiently.

This is the most effective path to achieving state-of-the-art, specialized performance on consumer hardware within a zero-cost framework.

#### 2. The Models: Teacher vs. Student

**Teacher Model: `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct`**
-   **Role**: The "Subject Matter Expert" responsible for generating our training data. It will not be part of the final application.
-   **Why this model?**: It is a top-tier, 16B parameter, open-source coding model specifically designed to follow instructions. Its architectural similarity to our backbone makes it an ideal "peer expert" for distillation. It is powerful enough to reason through the most complex programming tasks we require for training data, yet it can be run on a 16GB GPU (like the V100 in our GCP instance) with quantization. This choice is supported by community benchmarks and discussions on platforms like the Hugging Face forums, which rank it among the best available open-weight coding models.
-   **Execution**: We will run this model on our temporary GCP cloud VM to generate the synthetic datasets.

**Student Backbone: `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite`**
-   **Role**: The foundational engine for the final Tanuki-Programmer application.
-   **Why this model?**: It is a powerful 16B base model (non-instruct) that provides a robust foundation in code intelligence. We are not training this model itself; instead, we are attaching small, efficient LoRA adapters to it, which are trained to guide its behavior for specific tasks.

#### 3. The Distillation Workflow

The process is repeated for each of the 127 agents:

1.  **Define the Agent's Task**: For each agent (e.g., `tanuki-debugger`), we create a "synthesis prompt." This master prompt instructs the Teacher Model exactly how to behave. For the debugger, this prompt would be: "Given a code snippet, a user-reported issue, and a stack trace, analyze the root cause, explain it clearly, and provide the corrected code. Use available tools through proper API calls. Your thought process should be explicit."
2.  **Generate a Synthetic Dataset**: We feed the Teacher Model problems from our open-source datasets (e.g., bug-fixing scenarios from `microsoft/CodeXGLUE` for the debugger). The Teacher Model uses the synthesis prompt to generate thousands of high-quality, perfectly formatted `(problem, ideal_solution)` pairs that include proper tool usage patterns. This becomes our new training dataset.
3.  **Fine-Tune the Student Adapter**: We use the new, high-quality synthetic dataset to fine-tune a single LoRA adapter (e.g., `tanuki-debugger.safetensors`). This tuning process happens on the `DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite` (student) backbone. The adapter learns the specialized patterns and behaviors demonstrated by the teacher, including how to properly request and interpret tool usage.

#### 4. Zero-Cost Execution Plan

-   **Compute (GCP)**: The `$300` in GCP free trial credits is more than sufficient for the ~297 hours of `n1-high-mem-8 + NVIDIA V100` VM time needed. This time will be used for both generating the synthetic datasets with the teacher model and for fine-tuning all 127 student adapters.
-   **Storage (Local)**: The 1TB external SSD will be used to download and store the foundational open-source datasets (like `the-stack-v2`), avoiding cloud storage costs. Data will be uploaded to the GCP VM's temporary storage as needed for processing and training runs.

### 3.3 Data Synthesis Example

```python
def synthesize_programming_data(code_snippet_from_the_stack):
    return {
        "instruction": f"Implement: {extract_docstring(code_snippet_from_the_stack)}",
        "thought": "I need to analyze the requirements, write code, and validate it using available tools.",
        "tool_calls": [
            {"tool": "write_file", "content": code_snippet_from_the_stack},
            {"tool": "run_terminal_cmd", "command": "python -m py_compile solution.py"},
            {"tool": "run_tests", "file": "test_solution.py"}
        ],
        "final_answer": code_snippet_from_the_stack
    }
```

---

## 4. Host Environment Integration

### 4.1 Tool-Agnostic Design Philosophy

Our agents are designed to be **tool-aware** but **tool-agnostic**. They understand the concepts and usage patterns of common development tools (file operations, terminal commands, testing frameworks, etc.) but do not contain implementations of these tools. Instead, they request tool usage through the host environment's API.

This design provides several key advantages:
- **Compatibility**: Works with any tool-providing environment (Cline, other extensions, MCP servers)
- **Extensibility**: Automatically gains access to new tools as the host environment adds them
- **Maintainability**: No tool infrastructure to build, test, or maintain
- **Standards Compliance**: Leverages existing tool ecosystems and standards

### 4.2 Common Tool Categories

Our agents are trained to understand and utilize these categories of tools commonly provided by development environments:

| Tool Category | Examples | Agent Usage |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **File Operations** | `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_files` | Reading project context, generating/modifying code |
| **Terminal Commands** | `run_terminal_cmd`, `execute_shell` | Running tests, linters, compilers, package managers |
| **Code Analysis** | `codebase_search`, `find_references` | Understanding project structure and dependencies |
| **Development Tools** | Language servers, formatters, debuggers | Code quality, error detection, optimization |
| **Version Control** | Git operations, diff tools | Change tracking, collaboration, rollback |
| **Testing & Validation** | Test runners, coverage tools, security scanners | Quality assurance, compliance verification |

## 7. Packaging & Deployment

### 7.1 Local Deployment: Pure Cognitive Layer

The Tanuki-Programmer is designed as a pure cognitive layer that integrates seamlessly with any tool-providing environment. The system requires no built-in tool infrastructure, making deployment lightweight and focused.

The entire system will be packaged using **Docker Compose** to ensure a simple, one-command startup process (`docker-compose up`). The Docker setup will consist of two primary services:

1.  **Inference Server (`vLLM`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: To serve the `DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite` base model and handle the high-throughput inference requests.
    *   **Configuration**: vLLM is specifically chosen for its ability to load the base model and all 127 LoRA adapters simultaneously. It can apply a different adapter for each incoming API request from the Orchestrator, which is the key technical requirement for our Mixture-of-Agents approach.

2.  **Orchestrator Service**:
    *   **Purpose**: This is the "brain" of the system. This container runs the main Python application that implements the `Dynamic World Model`, the planning loops, and the agent routing logic.
    *   **Function**: It receives user requests from the host environment, decides which specialist agent is needed, makes calls to the vLLM service with the correct LoRA adapter, and coordinates tool usage requests back to the host environment.

This simplified, two-container setup provides the necessary cognitive intelligence while remaining lightweight and focused. Tool execution is handled entirely by the host environment (e.g., Cline), keeping our system portable and compatible.

### 7.2 Monetization & Distribution Strategy

Monetizing an agentic cognitive layer like Tanuki-Programmer focuses on the value of the specialized intelligence rather than infrastructure complexity.

The long-term monetization strategy will focus on one of the following three paths:

1.  **Distribution of Packaged Cognitive Layer (Primary Path)**: The most direct path to monetization is to sell the complete, packaged cognitive system as a professional developer tool. The product would include:
    *   The 127 expertly trained LoRA adapter weights.
    *   The orchestrator source code.
    *   The `docker-compose.yml` file for easy, self-hosted deployment.
    This allows individuals and teams to run the powerful cognitive layer in their own secure environment with their preferred tools.

2.  **Hosted Cognitive-as-a-Service (Advanced Path)**: This involves creating a cloud-hosted version of the cognitive layer.
    *   **Architecture**: We would host the Tanuki-Programmer cognitive system on our own cloud infrastructure.
    *   **Interface**: Users would interact with the service via API calls from their preferred development environment (Cline, other extensions, custom integrations).
    *   **Model**: This would be a usage-based model, charging for cognitive processing while users maintain control over their tools and data.

3.  **Agentic Distillation into a Single Model (Research Path)**: This is a frontier research direction that involves an attempt to "distill" the intelligence of the entire agentic system into a single, fine-tuned model.
    *   **Process**: Use the running Tanuki-Programmer system to solve thousands of complex problems, recording the successful final outcomes. Use this generated dataset to perform a massive fine-tuning run on a new base model.
    *   **Goal**: To create a single, powerful model that implicitly captures the planning and tool-use capabilities of the agentic system. If successful, this resulting model could potentially be hosted on platforms like OpenRouter.

### 7.3 Direct Integration with the Cline Extension

This architecture is designed for a direct, seamless integration with the Cline IDE extension. The system runs as a local server, and you configure the Cline extension to use it as its backend model provider. From your perspective inside the editor, Tanuki-Programmer will function as the powerful, private, and instantly available "brain" behind all of Cline's actions.

The integration process involves two simple steps: running our local server and pointing the Cline extension to it.

#### Step 1: Run the Local Tanuki-Programmer Server

Just as you would need to have the Ollama application running in the background, you first need to start the Tanuki-Programmer server. This is done with a single command from your project terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command handles all the complexity, starting the inference engine and the orchestrator. It will expose a single, local API endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/v1`) for the Cline extension to connect to.

#### Step 2: Configure the Cline Extension

You only need to do this once inside your IDE (e.g., Cursor, VS Code).

1.  **Navigate to Cline's Settings**: Open the Cline extension's settings panel. This can typically be accessed via the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` and searching for "Cline Settings") or from the IDE's extensions tab.
2.  **Set the Custom Model Provider**: In Cline's settings, locate the options for "Model Provider" or "Custom Server". Configure it with the following details:
    *   **Model Name / ID**: `tanuki-programmer` (or any other alias you prefer).
    *   **API Base URL**: `http://localhost:8000/v1` (or whichever port is configured in your `docker-compose.yml`).
    *   **API Key**: Leave blank or enter any value. It is not used for the local server.
3.  **Start Coding with Cline**: With the settings saved, all subsequent interactions with the Cline extension will now be powered by your local Tanuki-Programmer system.

This workflow provides a fully integrated and seamless experience, allowing you to leverage the full power of your 127-agent cognitive system directly within your editor via the Cline interface, while Cline handles all tool execution using its built-in capabilities and any configured MCP servers.
