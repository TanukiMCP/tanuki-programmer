# Tanuki-STEM: Domain-Specialized MoA for Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics

## 1. Domain Vision & Scope

### 1.1. Core Mission
Tanuki-STEM is a specialized Mixture-of-Agents system designed to excel at scientific computation, mathematical reasoning, engineering problem-solving, and technical analysis. It integrates computational engines with domain expertise to provide accurate, verifiable solutions across STEM disciplines.

### 1.2. Sub-Domain Coverage
The system covers the breadth of STEM fields with specialized, computationally-grounded agents:

| Sub-Domain | Expert Agent | Primary Capabilities |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Planning & Strategy** | `tanuki-planner-critic` | **(Foresight Agent)** Generates and critiques multiple computational or experimental paths before execution. |
| **Pure Mathematics** | `tanuki-mathematician` | Calculus, algebra, number theory, proofs, symbolic computation. |
| **Applied Mathematics** | `tanuki-applied-math` | Statistics, optimization, numerical methods, modeling. |
| **Physics & Engineering** | `tanuki-physicist` | Mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, simulations. |
| **Data Science & Analytics**| `tanuki-data-scientist`| Statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization. |

## 2. Ultra-Low-Cost Hybrid Training Strategy

This project adheres to a strict budget by pioneering a hyper-efficient hybrid training model that costs a total of **~$120 for all 32 expert agents** across four flagship domains.

### 2.1. The "One-Weekend-Rent" Model
All expensive training steps are consolidated into a single 72-hour rental of an RTX 4090 GPU (~$30 total cost).

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation Training (Synthetic Data - Cost: $0)**
    -   **Process**: Open-source datasets (e.g., `hendrycks/MATH`, `allenai/scibench`) are transformed programmatically into ReAct-style training examples. This builds a foundational understanding of scientific problem-solving and computational tool use for free.
    
2.  **Phase 2: Teacher-Guided Refinement (Process-Oriented Reward)**
    -   **Process**: During the GPU rental, a powerful teacher model ([WizardMath-70B-V1.0](https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardMath-70B-V1.0)) is used for a short, intense burst of inference.
    -   **Student Model Choice**: We will use **Phi-3-mini-4K-Instruct**, which excels at reasoning and can be fine-tuned for longer context.
    -   **Training Methodology (Process-Oriented Reward)**: We reward the entire reasoning chain, not just the final numerical answer. The training data will explicitly prefer logical, verifiable computational steps over "black box" solutions, teaching the model to show its work and rely on its tools.

## 3. Architecture Design

### 3.1. Zero-Cost Data Sources & Synthesis Pipeline

All foundation training data is sourced from free, open-source Hugging Face datasets. Each dataset is chosen to train specific expert agents within the MoA.

| Expert Agent | Primary HF Dataset(s) | Usage & Synthesis Strategy |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **`tanuki-mathematician`** | `meta-math/MetaMathQA` | A large dataset of math problems with solutions. Used to train the agent to recognize mathematical notation and structure, and to call the symbolic computation engine for solving. |
| **`tanuki-applied-math`** | `HuggingFaceH4/CodeAlpaca_20k` (filtered for Python/R) | Contains code for statistical analysis. We will synthesize examples where the agent must take a problem description and generate the correct statistical code. |
| **`tanuki-physicist`** | `physion/dataset` | A dataset of physical scenarios and outcomes. Used to train the agent to identify the physical principles at play and set up appropriate simulations. |
| **`tanuki-chemist`** | `Open-Orca/FLAN-v2` (filtered for chemistry) | A general instruction-following dataset. We will filter for chemistry-related tasks to train the agent on molecular properties, reactions, and calling chemical modeling tools. |
| **`tanuki-biologist`** | `longluu/meddialog` | A medical dialogue dataset. Used to train the agent on bioinformatics, understanding biological queries, and interacting with life science databases. |
| **`tanuki-data-scientist`** | `PDUD/Kaggle_Notebook_Code_Generation` | A large dataset of Kaggle notebooks. Used to train the agent to perform data analysis, visualization, and machine learning tasks using libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn. |
| **`tanuki-researcher`** | `CShorten/ML-ArXiv-Papers` | A large corpus of scientific papers. Used to train the agent on literature review, finding relevant papers, and synthesizing information. |
| **`tanuki-science-writer`**| `emrgnt-cmplxty/sciphi-textbooks-are-all-you-need` | A dataset of scientific textbooks. Used to train the agent to write clear, structured, and accurate technical explanations and papers, often with LaTeX formatting. |

**Synthesis Example (`tanuki-mathematician`):**
```python
def synthesize_stem_data(problem_from_MetaMathQA):
    problem, solution = problem_from_MetaMathQA['query'], problem_from_MetaMathQA['response']
    return {
        "instruction": f"Solve this math problem: {problem}",
        "thought": "This is a symbolic math problem. I must use the computational engine to ensure accuracy.",
        "tool_calls": [
            {"tool": "sympy_compute", "expression": extract_math_expression(problem)},
        ],
        "final_answer": solution
    }
```

### 3.2. System Overview
The architecture is a multi-stage agentic system designed for foresight, execution, and review.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[STEM Query] --> B[Layer 1: Ingress & Sanitizer];
    B --> C[Layer 2: Foresight Agent (Planner-Critic)];
    C -- "Selects Optimal Plan" --> D[Layer 3: Orchestrator (Context Engineer)];
    
    subgraph "Layer 4: Execution & Adversarial Review"
        D -- "Routes to Expert" --> E(tanuki-mathematician);
        E -- "Draft Solution" --> F(tanuki-science-reviewer);
        F -- "Critique & Correction Request" --> E;
        F -- "Approved Solution" --> G[Layer 5: Response Aggregator];
    end
    
    G --> H[Verified Scientific Solution];
```

### 3.3. Core Architectural Layers

| Layer | Component | Function |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | **Ingress & Sanitizer** | Cleans and validates scientific notation and user input. |
| 2 | **Foresight Agent** | Generates 2-3 high-level plans (e.g., "Plan A: Solve symbolically. Plan B: Use a numerical approximation.") and critiques them to select the most robust computational path. |
| 3 | **Orchestrator Agent** | Assembles the "briefing packet" (papers, data, etc.) based on the selected plan and routes it to the appropriate expert. |
| 4 | **Execution & Review Loop** | An expert agent (`tanuki-mathematician`) generates a solution. This draft is immediately sent to an adversarial `tanuki-science-reviewer`, whose sole job is to find mathematical errors or logical flaws. If any are found, the solution is sent back for refinement. |
| 5 | **Response Aggregator** | Formats the final, peer-reviewed, and computationally validated solution for the user. |

### 3.4. Specialized Computational Tools

| Sub-Domain | Computational Stack |
|:---|:---|
| **Pure Mathematics** | SymPy, SageMath, Lean theorem prover, Mathematica interface |
| **Applied Mathematics** | NumPy, SciPy, CVXPY, OR-Tools, optimization libraries |
| **Physics & Engineering** | FEniCS, OpenFOAM, COMSOL interface, simulation frameworks |
| **Chemistry & Materials** | RDKit, OpenMM, GROMACS, quantum chemistry packages |
| **Biology & Life Sciences** | BioPython, Scanpy, NetworkX, phylogenetic tools |
| **Data Science** | Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, visualization libraries |
| **Research Tools** | ArXiv API, PubMed integration, citation managers |
| **Technical Writing** | LaTeX, Jupyter notebooks, scientific plotting |

### 3.3. Leveraging Large Context for Advanced Scientific Workflows

The ability to use a large context window is the cornerstone of the Tanuki-STEM's effectiveness. The Orchestrator Agent uses this vast space to construct a "briefing packet" for the expert agent on every turn, enabling it to tackle complex, multi-step scientific problems.

**Example Briefing Packet for a Data Analysis Task:**
```
<CONTEXT>
  <CONVERSATION_HISTORY>
    <!-- Full, unabridged user-AI dialogue about the research goal -->
  </CONVERSATION_HISTORY>

  <RELEVANT_PAPERS>
    <!-- Full text of a key reference paper on the methodology -->
  </RELEVANT_PAPERS>
  
  <DATASET_PREVIEW>
    <!-- The first 50 rows of the CSV dataset to be analyzed -->
  </DATASET_PREVIEW>

  <TOOL_SCHEMAS>
    <!-- Full JSON schema for the 'pandas_profiler' and 'seaborn_plotter' tools -->
  </TOOL_SCHEMAS>
  
  <USER_QUERY>
    Using the attached data, can you replicate the statistical analysis from the reference paper and plot the results?
  </USER_QUERY>
</CONTEXT>
```
This approach allows the expert agent to hold all the necessary context—the goal, the method, the data, and the tools—in memory at once, leading to a coherent and accurate workflow that is impossible with smaller context windows.
