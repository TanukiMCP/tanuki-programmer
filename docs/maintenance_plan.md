# Tanuki-Programmer Maintenance Plan

This document outlines a conceptual maintenance plan for the Tanuki-Programmer system, covering key aspects of monitoring, logging, and update procedures to ensure its continued reliability, performance, and security.

## 1. Monitoring Strategy

Effective monitoring is crucial for identifying issues proactively, tracking performance, and understanding system behavior.

### 1.1. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
-   **Metrics to Collect:**
    -   **Request Latency:** Time taken for API requests (`/run_task`, `/health`).
    -   **Error Rates:** Percentage of failed requests (e.g., 5xx errors from API, sandbox execution failures).
    -   **Throughput:** Number of requests per second.
    -   **Resource Utilization:** CPU, memory, VRAM usage of the main application and sandbox containers.
    -   **LLM Inference Time:** Time taken for individual LLM calls (backbone and adapter inference).
    -   **Adapter Load/Unload Times:** Latency associated with dynamic adapter management.
-   **Tools:**
    -   **Google Cloud Monitoring (Stackdriver):** For Cloud Run deployments, automatically collects many metrics.
    -   **Prometheus/Grafana:** For more custom metrics and dashboards, especially if deployed on GKE.
    -   **Python Libraries:** Use libraries like `prometheus_client` or integrate with OpenTelemetry for custom application metrics.

### 1.2. Infrastructure Monitoring
-   **Metrics to Collect:**
    -   Container health and restarts.
    -   Disk I/O and network traffic.
    -   Ollama instance health and resource usage (if running separately).
-   **Tools:**
    -   **Google Cloud Monitoring:** For Cloud Run and GKE infrastructure.
    -   **Docker Stats:** For local Docker container monitoring.

### 1.3. Alerting
-   **Critical Alerts:** High error rates, service unavailability, resource exhaustion (e.g., memory reaching 90%).
-   **Warning Alerts:** Increased latency, unusual traffic patterns, frequent container restarts.
-   **Channels:** PagerDuty, Slack, Email, SMS.

## 2. Logging Strategy

Comprehensive logging is essential for debugging, auditing, and understanding the flow of operations within the system.

### 2.1. Log Levels
-   **DEBUG:** Detailed information, typically only enabled during development or specific troubleshooting.
-   **INFO:** General operational messages, task submissions, successful completions.
-   **WARNING:** Potential issues that don't immediately cause failure but might indicate problems (e.g., rate limit approaching).
-   **ERROR:** Runtime errors, exceptions, failed task executions.
-   **CRITICAL:** Severe errors leading to system instability or shutdown.

### 2.2. Log Content
-   **Request/Response Logs:** API request details, task IDs, input parameters (sanitized), and output results.
-   **Agent Activity Logs:** Which agent was invoked, its input briefing, and its raw output.
-   **Tool Execution Logs:** Details of external tool calls (e.g., linter output, compiler errors from sandbox).
-   **Resource Management Logs:** Adapter loading/unloading events, memory budget adjustments.
-   **Error Traces:** Full stack traces for exceptions.

### 2.3. Log Aggregation & Analysis
-   **Google Cloud Logging (Stackdriver Logging):** For centralized log collection, searching, and analysis in GCP.
-   **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):** For self-hosted deployments, powerful for log aggregation and visualization.
-   **Structured Logging:** Use JSON format for logs to facilitate easier parsing and querying.

## 3. Update Procedures

Regular updates are necessary for security patches, bug fixes, performance improvements, and new feature rollouts.

### 3.1. Versioning
-   **Semantic Versioning:** Use `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for releases (e.g., `v0.1.0`).
-   **Docker Image Tagging:** Tag Docker images with version numbers and commit SHAs.

### 3.2. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
-   **Automated Builds:** Use Cloud Build (`deploy/gcp/cloudbuild.yaml`) or GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to automatically build Docker images on code changes.
-   **Automated Testing:** Integrate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests into the CI pipeline to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
-   **Automated Deployment:** Implement automated deployment to staging and production environments upon successful CI runs.

### 3.3. Deployment Strategy
-   **Blue/Green Deployments:** Deploy new versions alongside old ones, then switch traffic. This minimizes downtime and allows for quick rollbacks.
-   **Canary Deployments:** Gradually roll out new versions to a small subset of users before a full rollout, to detect issues early.
-   **Rollback Plan:** Have a clear procedure to revert to a previous stable version in case of critical issues.

### 3.4. Model Updates
-   **Model Versioning:** Maintain versions of the Mistral-3B backbone and LoRA adapters.
-   **Retraining Schedule:** Establish a schedule for retraining models with new data or improved techniques.
-   **A/B Testing:** Test new model versions against old ones in production to ensure performance improvements.

### 3.5. Security Updates
-   Regularly update base images and dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
-   Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing.

## 4. Incident Response Plan

-   **Detection:** Monitoring and alerting systems detect anomalies.
-   **Triage:** Assess the severity and impact of the incident.
-   **Investigation:** Use logs and metrics to pinpoint the root cause.
-   **Mitigation:** Implement temporary fixes to restore service.
-   **Resolution:** Apply permanent solutions.
-   **Post-Mortem:** Document the incident, analyze causes, and identify preventative measures.

This maintenance plan provides a framework for ensuring the long-term health and effectiveness of the Tanuki-Programmer system.
