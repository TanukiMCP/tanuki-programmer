### 2.3 Dynamic Specialization: Backbone & Adapters

The core efficiency comes from the backbone model architecture with hotswappable specialization:

#### Backbone Model
- **Base Model**: DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite (16B) with 128k context window
- **Architecture**: Advanced transformer with RoPE, SwiGLU, and Grouped-Query Attention
- **Parameters**: 16B total
- **Quantization**: IQ4_XS GGUF for balanced performance and VRAM efficiency
- **Memory Usage**: ~7.5GB VRAM (leaving a healthy ~0.5GB buffer for system stability)
- **Always Active**: Provides state-of-the-art code intelligence and reasoning.

#### LoRA Adapter System
- **127 Specialized Adapters**: Comprehensive language coverage supporting DeepSeek-Coder-V2's 338 languages (~160MB each, scaled for 16B base)
- **Instantaneous Switching**: All 127 adapters are pre-loaded into system RAM.
- **System RAM Usage**: ~20.3GB for the adapter pool (127 × 160MB, from 48GB total), eliminating all loading latency.

### 2.4 Context Management & Briefing Packets

The 128k context window enables comprehensive briefing packets for each expert:

```
<CONTEXT>
  <CONVERSATION_HISTORY>
    <!-- Complete user-AI dialogue -->
  </CONVERSATION_HISTORY>

  <RELEVANT_FILES>
    <!-- Full content of project files -->
  </RELEVANT_FILES>

  <TOOL_SCHEMAS>
    <!-- Complete tool specifications -->
  </TOOL_SCHEMAS>

    <!-- Domain-specific examples -->
  </FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES>
  
  <USER_QUERY>
    <!-- Current specific request -->
  </USER_QUERY>
</CONTEXT>
```

### 2.5 Resource Management System

Sophisticated resource management ensures efficient operation:

```python
def load_adapter(agent_type: str):
    """Instantly switches the active adapter, as all are pre-loaded in RAM."""
    # No dynamic loading needed. Adapters are already in memory.
    # The 'load_lora_weights' function now just points to the active adapter.
    set_active_adapter(f"adapters/deepseek-coder-v2/{agent_type}.safetensors")
    update_system_prompt(get_agent_instructions(agent_type))
    
    # Performance: <1ms switch time as it's a simple pointer change.

def unload_lru_adapter():
    """No longer needed. All adapters are persistently loaded."""
    pass
```

## 3. Training Methodology & Datasets

### 3.1 Zero-Cost Foundation Training

All foundation training leverages free, open-source datasets from Hugging Face:

| Expert Agent | Primary Dataset | Synthesis Strategy |

| `tanuki-reviewer` | `bigcode/starcoderdata` | PR discussions paired with code changes |
| `tanuki-debugger` | `microsoft/CodeXGLUE` | Bug-fixing scenarios from error descriptions |
| `tanuki-tester` | `JetBrains-Research/test-generation` | Function-test pairs for comprehensive coverage |
| `tanuki-architect` | `CShorten/ML-ArXiv-Papers` | System design patterns from CS papers |
| `tanuki-devops` | `austin-taylor/dockerfiles` | Containerization and deployment configs |
| `tanuki-documenter` | `github/CodeSearchNet` | Code-documentation pairs |
| `tanuki-optimizer` | `google-research-datasets/stackoverflow_posts` | Performance optimization Q&A |

### 3.2 GCP-Powered Training & Distillation

The entire training process is designed to be completed within the **$280 GCP free trial budget**. We will use a preemptible `n1-high-mem-8` instance (8 vCPUs, 52 GB RAM) with an attached **NVIDIA Tesla V100 (16GB)** GPU.

- **Cost per Hour (Preemptible)**: ~$0.74 (GPU) + ~$0.27 (CPU/RAM) = **~$1.01/hour**
- **Total Available Training Hours**: $280 / $1.01/hour ≈ **277 hours**

**Training Time Scaling for DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite 16B:**
- **16B vs 3B Parameter Ratio**: 5.3x larger model
- **Training Time Scaling**: ~3.5x (sublinear due to efficiency optimizations)
- **Estimated Training Time per Adapter**: ~7 hours (vs 2 hours for 3B)

This budget is allocated across three phases:

| Phase | Activity | Estimated Hours | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | **Data Preprocessing** | 35 hours | Downloading, cleaning, and preparing all 127 Hugging Face datasets for 16B model. |
| 2 | **Teacher Model Inference** | 50 hours | Running teacher models to generate high-quality examples (reduced due to better base model). |
| 3 | **Student Fine-Tuning** | 182 hours | Executing QLoRA fine-tuning for 26 critical adapters (~7 hours each). |
| 4 | **Remaining Adapters** | 10 hours | Fine-tune remaining 65 adapters using transfer learning from core adapters. |
| | **Total** | **277 hours** | Optimized allocation leveraging 16B model's superior base capabilities. |

### 3.3 Data Synthesis Example

```python
def synthesize_programming_data(code_snippet_from_the_stack):
    return {
        "instruction": f"Implement: {extract_docstring(code_snippet_from_the_stack)}",
        "thought": "I need to write code, lint it, and test for correctness.",

## 4. Tooling & Integration Architecture

### 4.1 Domain-Specific Tool Suites

| Domain | Core Tools & Integrations |
|:---|:---|
| **Code Generation** | Language servers, syntax validators, formatters (Prettier, Black) |
| **Code Review** | ESLint, Pylint, SonarQube, Bandit security scanner |
| **Debugging** | GDB, debugpy, Chrome DevTools, memory profilers |
| **Testing** | pytest, Jest, JUnit, coverage.py, Codecov |
| **Architecture** | PlantUML, Mermaid, database design tools |
| **DevOps** | Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions |
| **Security** | OWASP ZAP, TruffleHog, Snyk, Semgrep |
| **Cloud Operations** | AWS CLI, Azure CLI, GCP gcloud, multi-cloud SDKs |
| **Frontend** | Webpack, Babel, npm/yarn, browser dev tools |
| **Mobile** | Xcode, Android Studio, React Native CLI, Flutter |
| **Data Engineering** | Apache Spark, Kafka, Airflow, dbt |
| **Documentation** | Sphinx, JSDoc, OpenAPI generators, Gitiles |

### 4.2 Tool Abstraction Layer (TAL)
To ensure consistency and modularity, agents do not call tools directly. Instead, they interact with a **Tool Abstraction Layer (TAL)**. The TAL provides a standardized interface for all tools, handling execution, error management, and input/output validation.

All tools must conform to the following Python interface:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Dict, Any

class BaseTool(ABC):
    """
    Interface for all tools integrated into the Tanuki-Programmer system.
    """

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def name(self) -> str:
        """The unique name of the tool."""
        pass

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def description(self) -> str:
        """A detailed description of what the tool does."""
        pass

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def schema(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """JSON schema defining the tool's input parameters."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, **kwargs) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Executes the tool with the given parameters.
        Returns a dictionary with results, logs, and status.
        """
        pass

```
This standardized approach allows for seamless integration of diverse tools—from simple linters to complex cloud CLIs—and enables the Orchestrator to reason about tool capabilities programmatically.

## 7. Economic Analysis & ROI

### 7.1 Cost Breakdown

This analysis provides a realistic, bottom-up estimate of the costs associated with developing and operating the Tanuki-Programmer.

#### One-Time Development & Training Costs
| Item | Vendor/Service | Quantity | Cost | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| **GPU-Enabled Compute** | Google Cloud (GCP) | 277 hours | $280 | Covered entirely by GCP free trial credits. |
| **Persistent Disk Storage** | Google Cloud (GCP) | 1 TB/month | ~$40 | Storing datasets and model checkpoints during the training month. |
| **Total One-Time Cost** | | | **~$40** | The only out-of-pocket expense is for storage. |

#### Recurring Operational Costs (Monthly)
