# User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan for Tanuki-Programmer

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for organizing and executing User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for the Tanuki-Programmer LLM. The goal of UAT is to validate the system's functionality, usability, and overall effectiveness from the perspective of diverse developer groups, collecting both qualitative and quantitative feedback.

## 1. UAT Objectives

- **Validate Core Functionality:** Ensure all implemented features (code generation, debugging, refactoring, testing, etc.) work as expected in real-world development scenarios.
- **Assess Usability & Workflow Integration:** Evaluate how seamlessly Tanuki-Programmer integrates into existing developer workflows and its ease of use.
- **Identify Gaps & Pain Points:** Uncover any missing features, usability issues, or areas where the system falls short of user expectations.
- **Collect Performance Feedback:** Gather subjective feedback on response times, code quality, and overall efficiency.
- **Measure User Satisfaction:** Quantify user satisfaction and willingness to adopt the tool.

## 2. Participant Selection

To ensure diverse and representative feedback, UAT participants should be selected from various developer groups, including:

- **Experience Levels:** Junior, Mid-level, Senior Developers.
- **Programming Languages:** Developers proficient in Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust, etc.
- **Specializations:** Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Data Science, Security, QA Engineers.
- **Project Types:** Participants working on different types of projects (web apps, mobile apps, data pipelines, embedded systems).

**Recommended Group Size:** 10-20 participants for initial UAT, with potential for expansion based on feedback.

## 3. UAT Phases & Activities

### Phase 1: Preparation & Onboarding (1-2 weeks)

- **3.1. Define Test Scenarios:**
    - Based on the "Real-World Test Scenarios" (Legacy Migration, Cloud Deployment, PCI-DSS, Data Pipeline), create specific, actionable tasks for participants.
    - Include a mix of common development tasks and complex problem-solving scenarios.
    - Example: "Migrate a given Python 2 script to Python 3 using Tanuki-Programmer and verify its functionality."
- **3.2. Develop Feedback Mechanisms:**
    - **Quantitative:** Surveys (Likert scale for satisfaction, ease of use, code quality), task completion rates, time-on-task metrics.
    - **Qualitative:** Open-ended questions, structured interviews, bug reporting system, direct observation sessions.
- **3.3. Prepare Documentation:**
    - Provide clear instructions for accessing and using Tanuki-Programmer.
    - Include a UAT guide with scenario descriptions, expected outcomes, and feedback submission guidelines.
    - Set up a dedicated communication channel (e.g., Slack, Discord) for real-time support and discussions.
- **3.4. Onboarding Sessions:**
    - Conduct introductory sessions to explain the UAT process, demonstrate Tanuki-Programmer's capabilities, and answer initial questions.

### Phase 2: Execution & Data Collection (2-4 weeks)

- **4.1. Task Execution:**
    - Participants work through the defined test scenarios using Tanuki-Programmer in their own development environments.
    - Encourage participants to use the tool as they would in their daily work.
- **4.2. Feedback Submission:**
    - Participants submit quantitative survey responses after completing each task or at regular intervals.
    - Participants log bugs, issues, and suggestions in the designated bug tracking system.
    - Encourage participants to provide detailed qualitative feedback through open-ended questions or journaling.
- **4.3. Observation & Interviews:**
    - Conduct scheduled observation sessions (e.g., screen sharing) with a subset of participants to understand their interaction patterns and identify unspoken pain points.
    - Conduct one-on-one or group interviews to delve deeper into their experiences, challenges, and suggestions.

### Phase 3: Analysis & Reporting (1-2 weeks)

- **5.1. Data Aggregation:**
    - Collect and aggregate all quantitative data (survey responses, task metrics).
    - Categorize and synthesize qualitative feedback (bugs, suggestions, general comments).
- **5.2. Feedback Analysis:**
    - Identify common themes, recurring issues, and critical bugs.
    - Prioritize issues based on severity and impact.
    - Analyze quantitative data to identify trends and areas for improvement.
- **5.3. UAT Report Generation:**
    - Compile a comprehensive UAT report summarizing findings, key insights, and actionable recommendations for product improvement.
    - Include both raw data (anonymized) and summarized conclusions.
    - Present the report to relevant stakeholders (development team, product management).

## 4. Feedback Mechanisms & Metrics

### Quantitative Feedback:

- **Surveys:**
    - Likert scale questions (1-5 or 1-7) for:
        - Overall satisfaction with Tanuki-Programmer.
        - Ease of use/learning curve.
        - Quality of generated code/suggestions.
        - Helpfulness in debugging/refactoring.
        - Integration with existing tools/workflow.
        - Likelihood to recommend to a colleague.
- **Task Completion Rate:** Percentage of tasks successfully completed by participants.
- **Time on Task:** Time taken to complete specific scenarios (can be compared to manual completion times if baseline data is available).
- **Bug Density:** Number of bugs reported per feature or per hour of usage.

### Qualitative Feedback:

- **Open-ended Survey Questions:** "What did you like most/least?", "What features would you add?", "Describe a scenario where Tanuki-Programmer significantly helped/hindered you."
- **Bug Reports:** Detailed descriptions of issues, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, screenshots/logs.
- **Interviews/Discussions:** Unstructured or semi-structured conversations to gather deeper insights into user experience, mental models, and unmet needs.
- **User Journals/Diaries:** Participants log their daily interactions, thoughts, and challenges with the tool.

## 5. Tools & Resources

- **Communication:** Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams.
- **Bug Tracking:** Jira, GitHub Issues, Asana.
- **Survey Platform:** Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, Qualtrics.
- **Documentation:** Confluence, Notion, GitHub Wiki.
- **Screen Recording/Observation:** Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Loom.

This UAT plan provides a structured approach to gather critical user feedback, ensuring the Tanuki-Programmer LLM meets the practical needs and expectations of its target developer audience.
