Here are examples of programming tasks that could be covered in tutorials:

### 2.1. Tutorial 1: Generating a Simple Python Function

-   **Task:** "Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number."
-   **Steps:**
    1.  Open CLI/UI.
    2.  Input task: "Create a Python function `factorial(n)` that calculates the factorial of `n`. Include docstrings and type hints."
    3.  Review generated code.
    4.  (Optional) Request unit tests: "Add unit tests for the `factorial` function."
-   **Focus:** Basic code generation, docstrings, type hints, unit test generation.

### 2.2. Tutorial 2: Debugging a JavaScript Error

-   **Task:** "Fix a bug in a given JavaScript function that incorrectly calculates array sum."
-   **Prerequisites:** Provide a `buggy_sum.js` file.
-   **Steps:**
    1.  Input task: "Debug the `sumArray` function in `buggy_sum.js`. It should correctly sum all numbers in an array."
    2.  Tanuki-Programmer identifies the bug (e.g., off-by-one error, incorrect loop).
    3.  Review suggested fix.
    4.  Apply fix and verify.
-   **Focus:** Debugging capabilities, code analysis, error identification.

### 2.3. Tutorial 3: Refactoring Legacy Java Code

-   **Task:** "Refactor a legacy Java class to use modern Java 8+ features."
-   **Prerequisites:** Provide a `LegacyClass.java` file.
-   **Steps:**
    1.  Input task: "Refactor `LegacyClass.java` to use Java 8 streams and lambda expressions where appropriate."
    2.  Review refactored code.
    3.  (Optional) Request performance optimization: "Optimize the refactored code for better performance."
-   **Focus:** Code refactoring, modernization, performance optimization.

### 2.4. Tutorial 4: Creating a Basic Web Component (HTML/CSS/JS)

-   **Task:** "Create a simple interactive button component with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."
-   **Steps:**
    1.  Input task: "Generate HTML for a button, CSS for styling it, and JavaScript to change its text on click."
    2.  Review generated files (`button.html`, `button.css`, `button.js`).
    3.  (Optional) Request integration into an existing page.
-   **Focus:** Multi-file generation, frontend development.

### 2.5. Tutorial 5: Generating a Dockerfile for a Python App

-   **Task:** "Generate a Dockerfile for a simple Python Flask application."
-   **Prerequisites:** Provide a `app.py` and `requirements.txt` for a Flask app.
-   **Steps:**
    1.  Input task: "Create a Dockerfile for the Flask application defined by `app.py` and `requirements.txt`."
    2.  Review generated Dockerfile.
    3.  (Optional) Request Docker Compose file for multi-service setup.
-   **Focus:** DevOps tasks, containerization.

## 3. Best Practices for Creating Tutorials

-   **Keep it concise:** Focus on one main task per tutorial.
-   **Use real-world examples:** Make tasks relatable to common developer problems.
-   **Provide clear code snippets:** Show both input and output code.
-   **Explain the "why":** Don't just show steps, explain the reasoning behind Tanuki-Programmer's actions.
-   **Encourage experimentation:** Suggest ways users can modify or extend the examples.
-   **Include screenshots/GIFs:** (For actual manuals) Visual aids are very helpful.

This outline provides a starting point for developing comprehensive user manuals and engaging tutorials for the Tanuki-Programmer.
