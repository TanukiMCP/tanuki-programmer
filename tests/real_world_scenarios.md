# Real-World Test Scenarios for Tanuki-Programmer

This document outlines the approach to conducting real-world test scenarios for the Tanuki-Programmer LLM, focusing on its practical applicability in complex development tasks. Each scenario describes the objective, the role of the Tanuki-Programmer, and the expected outcomes.

## 1. Legacy Migration Scenario

**Objective:** Evaluate Tanuki-Programmer's ability to assist in migrating a legacy codebase (e.g., Python 2 to Python 3, or an older framework to a newer one) by identifying outdated patterns, suggesting modern equivalents, and performing automated refactoring.

**Tanuki-Programmer's Role:**
- **Code Analysis:** Analyze the legacy codebase to identify deprecated syntax, libraries, and architectural patterns.
- **Modernization Suggestions:** Propose modern alternatives for identified legacy components (e.g., suggest `async/await` for old threading models, or `f-strings` for old string formatting).
- **Automated Refactoring:** Generate refactored code snippets or entire modules based on the modernization suggestions.
- **Test Generation:** Create unit or integration tests for the migrated code to ensure functional parity.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Tanuki-Programmer successfully identifies a high percentage of legacy code issues.
- Generated refactoring suggestions are accurate and lead to functional, modernized code.
- The time and effort required for manual migration are significantly reduced.
- Generated tests provide good coverage for the migrated components.

**Test Steps:**
1. Provide Tanuki-Programmer with a small, representative legacy codebase (e.g., a Python 2 script).
2. Prompt Tanuki-Programmer to analyze the code for migration to a modern equivalent (e.g., Python 3).
3. Review the analysis report, modernization suggestions, and generated refactored code.
4. Execute the refactored code and any generated tests to verify correctness.
5. Evaluate the quality and completeness of Tanuki-Programmer's output.

## 2. Multi-Service Cloud Deployment Scenario

**Objective:** Assess Tanuki-Programmer's capability to generate and manage infrastructure-as-code (IaC) for deploying a multi-service application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP), including service definitions, networking, and scaling configurations.

**Tanuki-Programmer's Role:**
- **IaC Generation:** Generate Terraform, CloudFormation, or ARM templates for deploying multiple interconnected services (e.g., a web app, an API, a database, a message queue).
- **Configuration Management:** Create configuration files for services (e.g., Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests).
- **Deployment Scripting:** Generate scripts for automating the deployment process.
- **Troubleshooting:** Assist in debugging deployment failures by analyzing logs and suggesting fixes.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Tanuki-Programmer generates valid and deployable IaC.
- The generated configurations correctly define the multi-service architecture.
- Deployment scripts are functional and automate the setup process.
- Tanuki-Programmer can provide useful insights for resolving deployment issues.

**Test Steps:**
1. Provide Tanuki-Programmer with a high-level description of a multi-service application and target cloud platform.
2. Prompt Tanuki-Programmer to generate IaC and deployment scripts.
3. Review the generated files for correctness and completeness.
4. (Optional, if environment allows) Attempt to deploy the application using the generated IaC and scripts.
5. Evaluate Tanuki-Programmer's output based on deployability and adherence to best practices.

## 3. PCI-DSS Payment Flow Scenario

**Objective:** Examine Tanuki-Programmer's understanding of security best practices and compliance requirements (specifically PCI-DSS) when designing or reviewing code for a payment processing flow.

**Tanuki-Programmer's Role:**
- **Security Review:** Analyze code for common vulnerabilities related to payment processing (e.g., improper handling of sensitive data, insecure communication, logging of cardholder data).
- **Compliance Suggestions:** Propose code modifications or architectural changes to ensure PCI-DSS compliance.
- **Secure Code Generation:** Generate code snippets for secure payment integration (e.g., tokenization, encryption, secure API calls).
- **Documentation:** Outline security considerations and compliance requirements for the payment flow.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Tanuki-Programmer identifies critical security flaws in payment-related code.
- Suggestions for compliance are accurate and actionable.
- Generated secure code snippets are robust and follow industry standards.
- Tanuki-Programmer demonstrates an understanding of PCI-DSS principles.

**Test Steps:**
1. Provide Tanuki-Programmer with a simplified code representation of a payment processing function (potentially with intentional vulnerabilities).
2. Prompt Tanuki-Programmer to perform a security review focusing on PCI-DSS compliance.
3. Review the identified vulnerabilities and suggested remediations.
4. Prompt Tanuki-Programmer to generate a secure version of the payment function.
5. Evaluate the quality of the security analysis and generated secure code.

## 4. Complex Data Pipeline Scenario

**Objective:** Test Tanuki-Programmer's ability to design, implement, and troubleshoot components of a complex data pipeline, including data ingestion, transformation, storage, and analysis.

**Tanuki-Programmer's Role:**
- **Pipeline Design:** Propose architecture and components for a data pipeline based on requirements (e.g., Kafka for ingestion, Spark for transformation, Snowflake for storage, Tableau for analysis).
- **Code Generation:** Generate code for data connectors, transformation logic, and data loading scripts.
- **Schema Definition:** Create data schemas (e.g., Avro, Protobuf, SQL DDL) for various stages of the pipeline.
- **Optimization Suggestions:** Identify bottlenecks and suggest performance optimizations for data processing.
- **Error Handling:** Propose robust error handling and logging mechanisms for pipeline components.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Tanuki-Programmer designs a logical and scalable data pipeline.
- Generated code for pipeline components is functional and efficient.
- Defined schemas are consistent and appropriate for the data.
- Tanuki-Programmer provides valuable insights for optimizing and debugging data flows.

**Test Steps:**
1. Provide Tanuki-Programmer with a description of a complex data problem (e.g., processing real-time sensor data, ETL from multiple sources).
2. Prompt Tanuki-Programmer to design a data pipeline and generate relevant code snippets.
3. Review the proposed design, generated code, and schemas.
4. (Optional) Integrate and test generated components within a simulated data environment.
5. Evaluate Tanuki-Programmer's understanding of data engineering principles and its ability to generate practical solutions.
